!!! DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU GIVE UP!!!

Answers to riddle:

1. "Stone" or "cube" is the block inside the toy-box. If you click on this block, it will spin, revealing the number three.
2. The "potted thing" is the plant. If you hover over the plant's pot, the face will move revealing the number five.
3. The "vision" or "window" is the tv. If you navigate to the right channel on the tv, you will find the number one.
4. The "colors trapped" refers to the picture of the rose. If you click on this picture, it will rotate out, revealing the number eight on the wall behind it.
5. The "navigation" refers to the maze. You must take the "seeker small" (the rat) to the end of it where it will find its "sweet temptation" (the cheese). Once that is done, the number two will be revealed.
6. The "world bound in ink" and the "paper dreams" refer to the books on the bookshelf. If you hover over these books, you will find that one of them has the number four on the cover.

Once all these numbers are found, you can click on the keypad on the back door. Then you can enter the number into the input bar, and that will take you to the final screen.

## Maze

I built the maze specificly for this but due to the complexity of it and the fact that I was really enjoying it as a standalone maze I decided to host it on on github pages and then just stuck a Iframe in the wall and targeted it. I also used a script I had created for testing to create a cheat button for you Tyler, I am going to remove that feature as soon as the hackathon is over.
