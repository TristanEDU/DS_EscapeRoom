To find the riddle for this room, you must click on the letter sitting on the table. Once you do this, you will be faced with a riddle.

Answers to riddle:

  1. Toy-box block: Click to reveal number three.
  2. Plant: Hover to reveal number five.
  3. TV: Find the right channel for number one.
  4. Rose: Click to reveal number eight.

1. "Stone" or "cube" is the block inside the toy-box. If you click on this block, it will spin, revealing the number three.
2. The "potted thing" is the plant. If you hover over the plant's pot, the face will move revealing the number five.
3. The "vision" or "window" is the tv. If you navigate to the right channel on the tv, you will find the number one.
4. The "colors trapped" refers to the picture of the rose. If you click on this picture, it will rotate out, revealing the number eight on the wall behind it.
5. The "navigation" refers to the maze. You must take the "seeker small" (the rat) to the end of it where it will find its "sweet temptation" (the cheese). Once that is done, the number two will be revealed.
6. The "world bound in ink" and the "paper dreams" refer to the books on the bookshelf. If you hover over these books, you will find that one of them has the number four on the cover.
