What I Built
I built the bookshelf, the rose picture, the plant, and the doors. I also wrote the riddle.

Technical Details

!!!!!!!!!!!SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

!!! DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU GIVE UP!!!

The books on the bookshelf pull out on hover. One of the covers has a four on it.

The rose picture rotates when clicked, revealing the number eight on the wall behind it.

The plant has a hover function on its pot. The number five is hidden inside.

The front door rotates open on hover, and the backdoor had a keypad that once clicked reveals a popup that allows you to input the secret code.

Answers to riddle:

Stanza 1. Refers to the block inside the toybox.
Stanza 2. Refers to the plant
Stanza 3. Refers to the tv
Stanza 4. Refers to the picture of the rose.
Stanza 5. Refers to the maze
Stanza 6. Refers to the bookshelf.

The final answer is 351824

Once all these numbers are found, you can click on the keypad on the back door. Then you can enter the number into the input bar, and that will take you to the final screen.

Fun Fact
The books are all of our favorites!

All the Javascript I used in this project, I learned specifically for this project. I did not know any of it beforehand.
